        <span>I want to take today to celebrate you and honor you.</span>
        <span>You are the highlight of my year, and I can never forget how I felt when I saw you that day on the 17th of May.</span>
        <span>Immediately, I felt intimidated by your aura and presence.</span>
        <span>I thought to myself, "Who is this classy babe?"</span>
        <span>I can still remember how you were paying attention to the English I was speaking.</span>
        <span>Looking back, I can't help but smile at how far we've come and be grateful for the love we share.</span>
        <span>Thank you for being you.</span>
        <span>Thank you for loving me.</span>
        <span>I still can't believe I almost lost you, sha.</span>
        <span>But thank Master Chisos, my God no gree!</span>
        <span>But on a more serious note, there's no one else I want more.</span>
        <span>No other lips I want to caress.</span>
        <span>No other hands I want holding mine.</span>
        <span>Please know that this boy values you a lot and I just want to say...</span>
        <span>Happy Birthday, Tami. I love you.</span>
